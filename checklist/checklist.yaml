Title: Checklist for Tests in Machine Learning Projects
# TODO: To be filled in later...
Description: Description about the project and its context
Test Areas:
  - Topic: General
    Description: >
      The following items describe best practices for all tests to be
      written.
    Tests:
      - Title: Write Descriptive Test Names
        Requirement: >
          Every test function should have a clear, descriptive name
        Explanation: >
          If out tests are narrow and sufficiently descriptive, the test
          name itself may give us enough information to start debugging.
          This also helps us to identify what is being tested inside the
          function.

      - Title: Keep Tests Focused
        Requirement: >
          Each test should only test one scenario, meaning that in each
          test we should only use one set of mock data.
        Explanation: >
          If we test multiple scenarios in a single test, it is hard to
          idenitfy exactly what went wrong. Keeping one scenario in a
          single test helps us to isolate problematic scenarios.

      - Title: Prefer Narrow Assertions in Unit Tests
        Requirement: >
          The assertions inside the tests should be narrow, meaning that
          when checking a complex object, any unrelated behavior should
          not be tested - Assert on only relevant behaviors.
        Explanation: >
          If we have overly wide assertions (such as depending on every
          field of a complex output proto), the test may fail for many
          unimportant reasons. False positives are the opoosite of
          actionable.

      - Title: Keep Cause and Effect Clear
        Requirement: >
          The modifications and the assertions of an object's behavior
          in a single test should not be far away from each other.
        Explanation: >
          Refrain from using large global test data structures shared
          across multiple unit tests. This will allow for clear
          identification of each test's setup and the cause and effect.

  - Topic: Data Presence
    Description: >
      The following items describe tests that need to be done for testing
      the presence of data.
    Tests:
      - Title: Dummy Title

        Explanation: >
          This is a dummy item to show how the checklist items would be
          stored inside this YAML file. It serves no other propose.
