## Summary

**Completeness Score**: 0/7

**The evaluation covers only the test functions written in Python.** The evaluation for the DeepSpeech project covers 3 test files, providing a comprehensive overview of the test coverage. There are areas needing improvement, such as ensuring data format correctness and model performance verification, etc. Overall, the test suite is robust with a completeness score of 0 out of 7. It could be the case where these areas are covered in test functions written in C.

**Completeness Score per Checklist Item**:

## Details

### 2.1 Ensure Data File Loads as Expected

**Requirement**: Ensure that data-loading functions correctly fetch datasets from predefined sources or online repositories. Additionally, verify that the functions handle errors or edge cases gracefully.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - (test_text.py) The code does not include any data-loading functions or verification of error handling.
  - (test_importers.py) The code does not include any functions related to data loading or error handling.
  - (test_value_range.py) The code does not include any functions related to data loading or error handling. The code provided contains test cases for checking the functionality of the value range functions.

**Function References:**

### 3.2 Data in the Expected Format

**Requirement**: Verify that the data matches the expected format. This involves checking the shape, data types, values, and any other properties.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - (test_text.py) The code does not include any checks for data format. It focuses on testing the encoding and decoding functionality of the Alphabet class.
  - (test_importers.py) The code does not include any checks or tests to verify that loaded data matches the expected format.The code includes tests to check if the labels match the expected format.
  - (test_value_range.py) The code does not include any checks or tests to verify that data matches the expected format. It focuses on testing value ranges and picking values from ranges.

**Function References:**

### 3.5 Check for Duplicate Records in Data

**Requirement**: Verify that there are no duplicate records in the loaded data.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - None of test function fulfilled

**Function References:**

### 4.2 Verify Data Split Proportion

**Requirement**: Check that the data is split into training and testing sets in the expected proportion. Verify the split by checking the actual fraction of data points in the training and test sets.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - None of test function fulfilled

**Function References:**

### 5.3 Ensure Model Output Shape Aligns with Expectation

**Requirement**: Ensure that the structure of the model's output matches the expected format based on the task, such as checking the dimensions of the output versus the number of labels in classification task.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - None of test function fulfilled

**Function References:**

### 6.1 Verify Evaluation Metrics Implementation

**Requirement**: Verify that the evaluation metrics are correctly implemented and appropriate for the model's task. Verify the metric computations with expected values to validate correctness.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - None of test function fulfilled

**Function References:**

### 6.2 Evaluate Model's Performance Against Thresholds

**Requirement**: Compute evaluation metrics for both the training and testing datasets. Verify that these metrics exceed threshold values, indicating acceptable model performance.

**Observations: Not Satisfied**

  - None of test function fulfilled
